# Welcome to vCluster scenario

We will:
- Create a vCluster using the vCluster.yaml
- View the differences between the vCluster and the Host Cluster
- Finish up and get ready for vCluster 103

Thanks for checking this guide out. We think vCluster is pretty cool and would love to hear from you if you have any feedback.
