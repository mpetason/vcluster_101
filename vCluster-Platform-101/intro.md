# Welcome to vCluster Platform 101 scenario


We will:
- Create a vCluster Cloud Account
- Create a Private Node vCluster and add our Ubuntu Node (Killercoda)
- Create a Pod on our vCluster Private Node Cluster

Thanks for checking this guide out. We think vCluster is pretty cool and would love to hear from you if you have any feedback.
