# Welcome to vCluster scenario

In this scenario we are going to cover most of the Quick-Start Guide (https://www.vcluster.com/docs/vcluster/) in the vCluster docs.

We will:
- Install the vCluster CLI
- Deploy a vCluster
- Inspect the vCluster
- Create a Deployment in the vCluster and view resources
- Disconnect from the vCluster and inspect the Host Cluster

We are going to keep the intro short and then move on to more customizations and more in depth options that you can use with your vCluster in the following scenarios. The purpose of this guide is to give you an easier option to get started with vCluster, especially if you do not currently have access to a Kubernetes Cluster.

Thanks for checking this guide out. We think vCluster is pretty cool and would love to hear from you if you have any feedback.
